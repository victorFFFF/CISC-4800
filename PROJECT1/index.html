                                Coronaviruses are viruses that circulate among animals with some of them also known to infect humans.
                                Bats are considered as natural hosts of these viruses yet several
                                other species of animals are also known to be a source. 
                                People who are infected may show little to no symptoms

                                Experts suggest that the virus came from consumption of bats. Bats carry many Coronaviruses. One of them may be COVID-19.
                                The virus has most likely been silently spreading through the streets for at least a few weeks. 
                                Ever since, COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly around the globe.</p>
